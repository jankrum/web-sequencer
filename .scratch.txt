Get all midi connections from list of connections
    - Get Midi Access
    - Use Midi Access to get individual connections
        -Make midiMap from Midi Access and direction
        - Check localStorage if we have a device name associated with a relationship
            - If we do have an associated name, we try to get that input/output port
                - The port is found and a connection is established, then we return it
            - Since we found a name in localStorage, but couldn't find a port with a matching
                name or could not get that port, then we delete that association from localStorage
        - If we did not find a relationship-device name association or we did but it was bad,
            we open an html dialog that the user will use to try to connect to a device
            - We iterate through the midiMap to get all the port names
            - If we did not find any port names, we throw an error
            - We build a form that will ask the user to select a device for
                a specific relationship with a select and submit button 
            - The user selects a port name they want to connect to
            - We store their selection in localStorage under the relationship name
            - Close the dialog
            - Return the port they selected
